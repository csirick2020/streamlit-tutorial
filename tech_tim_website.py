# Use 'streamlit run APP_NAME.py' in terminal to run the application

import streamlit as st

# st.write is considered a "magic command" in streamlit because
# it will automatically write pretty much anything you give it.
# Regular text (string)
st.write("hello world 123")
# Python object, like key, value pair
st.write({"key": "value"})
# Boolean value
st.write(True)
# Numbers (no string quotes)
st.write(123456)

# TODO: Will have to finish later as too much is going on right now...
